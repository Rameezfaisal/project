📌 Cell 4 — AUSP attributes (Critical & CE)
This cell extracts two material characteristics from the SAP AUSP table and prepares them for joining to NHA parts:
critical
From ATINN = '0000006193'
→ This is the SAP classification field that marks whether a part is Critical
ce
From ATINN = '0000015276' and ATWRT = 'Y'
→ This identifies parts that are CE-qualified
We convert these into two small lookup DataFrames keyed by NHA (objek), so they can be left-joined later when building OMAT_PART_DTLS.
In short:
Cell-4 translates SAP classification flags into Fabric-joinable attributes for each NHA.
