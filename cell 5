Cell 4 – Date window calculation (DT1WK, DT26WK)
Business purpose:
Defines the future demand horizon used for demand forecasting.
DT1WK = Start of the current week
DT26WK = End of the 26-week window (~6 months)
This creates the time window in which open sales orders are considered as demand for RSCXD parts.
👉 Business meaning:
“Look at all sales demand for the next 6 months, starting from this week.”
Cell 5 – NHALIST (Part Ecosystem Mapping)
Business purpose:
Identifies all RSCXD component parts and maps them to their parent assemblies (NHA/DASH) that are in the obsolescence program.
It:
Takes all OB-tracked part numbers
Links them to their Next Higher Assembly (NHA)
Keeps only parts that are Confirmed / In Review / In Work
👉 Business meaning:
“Which components belong to which aircraft/assembly, and are actively being tracked for obsolescence?”
This forms the official universe of valid RSCXD parts.
Cell 6 – LSTDATA (Explode part types)
Business purpose:
Creates one row per real physical part from the part ecosystem.
Each NHA has multiple types of parts:
R = Replaceable
C = Core
S = Spares
X = Exchange
D = Depot
This cell converts the SAP structure into:
Copy code

CMPPRTNO | DASH | NHA | TYPE
one row per actual material.
👉 Business meaning:
“List every sellable, usable, and stocked part that belongs to each RSCXD assembly.”
This is what later gets demand, stock, PO, and consumption applied.
Cell 7 – Build OMAT_RSCXD_DTLS (Master data table)
Business purpose:
Creates the master RSCXD part table used by planners.
It enriches every part with:
Description
Supplier
Lead time
Material status
Commodity hierarchy
Criticality & CE flags
And removes:
Obsolete or out-of-scope parts (OB, OS, OP)
👉 Business meaning:
“This is the golden list of all valid RSCXD parts with procurement and planning attributes.”
This table is the foundation for:
Demand
Consumption
Inventory
Open POs
Everything downstream depends on this being correct.
